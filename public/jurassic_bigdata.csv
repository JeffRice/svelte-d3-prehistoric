However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Some discovered as sidewalk flagstones (etc.) and traced to quarry in Middlefield.\r\nPerry: ""Powder Hill and Besek Lake near Durham, Conn. (six miles south of Middletown)."" - this corresponds to old sandstone quarries W of Middlefield.\r\nPowell: ""The Merritt Parkway through Connecticut crosses under U.S. Highway Alt. 6 north of Wallingford, Conn. Motorists driving east (toward Hartford) at this point should turn off on 6 towards Middletown. Several miles down this highway they will come to a fairly straight stretch marked only by a diner on the left-hand side. Opposite this diner will be a road going to the right and sign pointing to Durham. If I recall, this is Route 147. A few miles down this, one eventually goes down and around a steep curve to the left. Near the bottom of this curve there is a road turning off the main route and going uphill to the right. I cannot recall the name of the road, but it leads up the hill and towards a rest home of some sort—called ""Happy Acres"" of some such name. You will recognize this by many nicely kept buildings on both sides of the road—and a nice swimming pool near the main development on the left. About one and a half miles beyond this place is the quarry—on the right. A sign nailed to a tree used to indicate it as you approached it, but I believe it is now gone. Quarry is small but has many nice tracks. Incidentally, across the road in the nearest farmhouse lives a Mrs. Williston. She is the daughter of a famous American geologist and can tell those interested many details about the surrounding countryside.""\r\nFurther research showed that ""Happy Acres"" was a recreational park, now closed, and that the quarry is now the Powder Hill Dinosaur Park, at 105 Powder Hill Road, Middletown.

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Volkheimer et al. (2008) obtained a Bajocian-lowermost Bathonian age from a palynological sample from a section some kilometres south of the type locality of Eoabelisaurus. This age was confirmed on the basis of more extensive palynological samples by Zavattieri et al. (2010), who argued for an Aalenian-Bathonian age. Likewise, a K-Ar date of a basaltic intercalation close to Cerro Cóndor resulted in an Aalenian-Bajocian age (171 ± 5 Ma; Salani 2007), whereas an U-Pb age from a pyroclastic deposit gave an uppermost Bajocian-lowermost Bathonian age (167 ± 4 Ma; Cabaleri et al. 2010). Finally, a U-Pb date from a tuff near the base of the formation has even yielded a Toarcian age (Cúneo & Bowring 2010). These data thus indicate that the lacustrine levels of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation in the area of Cerro Cóndor probably range from the uppermost Toarcian to the lowermost Bathonian. Since Eoabelisaurus comes neither from the lowest, nor the highest parts of the sequence, we consider an Aalenian-Bajocian age as most likely for the sediments that have yielded this taxon.","The sediments are predominantly thin-layered, marly mudstones, representing the lacustrine sequence of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation (Stipanicic et al. 1968), which, in this area, is dominated by lacustrine marls, mudstones, and biogenic limestones, with frequent intercalations of conglomerates and tuffaceous material (Tasch & Volkheimer 1970; Turner 1983; Silva Nieto et al. 2002).",mudstone,planar lamination,,calcareous,Y,,,,,,"The sediments are predominantly thin-layered, marly mudstones, representing the lacustrine sequence of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation (Stipanicic et al. 1968), which, in this area, is dominated by lacustrine marls, mudstones, and biogenic limestones, with frequent intercalations of conglomerates and tuffaceous material (Tasch & Volkheimer 1970; Turner 1983; Silva Nieto et al. 2002).",mudstone,planar lamination,,calcareous,Y,,,,,,lacustrine - large,,"The sediments in the area where the holotype was found probably represent rather deeper parts of the lake, as evidenced by the fine grain size, often dark colour, and lack of conglomeratic intercalations and biogenic limestones.","Holotype: MPEF PV 3990, an almost complete skeleton",447,447,0,R.

Previously, it was tentatively considered to be Upper Jurassic, while Wang suggested that it might be attributed to the Middle Jurassic because of the likely presence of Neocalamites. Based on the structure of its middle dorsal vertebra, the Guangxi taxon resembles Shunosaurus, and various other basal Eusauropoda (Cetiosaurus, Barapasaurus, Patagosaurus, Omeisaurus, Mamenchisaurus and Yuanmousaurus). It appears to be more derived than Shunosaurus in having a more complex dorsal neural structure, and may be more primitive than Omeisaurus and Mamenchisaurus in having a platycoelous dorsal centrum with deep but simple lateral depressions. Similarities in vertebral structure also suggest a close relationship with Cetiosaurus, Barapasaur, and Patagosaurus. This may imply that the geological age of the fossil-bearing deposit of the Dongli Formation is probably Middle Jurassic""",,not reported,,,,,,,,,,,not reported,,,,,,,,,,terrestrial indet.,,,NHMG 10441 (a nearly complete middle dorsal vertebra),435,435,0,P.

Bubík (2010), however, mentioned different stratigraphic ranges of some foraminifer species reported from different European basins. Thus, the foraminifer-based stratigraphy may be corrected in the future. Further, the borehole Slatina 1, drilled close to the Švédské šance site, corresponds lithologically and stratigraphically to the limestones of the nearby Stránská skála locality, which ranges between the middle Oxfordian Perisphinctes plicatilis ammonite biozone and the lowest section of the upper Oxfordian Epipeltoceras bimammatum biozone (Eliáš 1981)",,"""limestone""",,,,Y,,,,,,,"""limestone""",,,,Y,,,,,,platform/shelf-margin reef,,"The Švédské šance fossil site is a part of the carbonate platform facies\r\nThe Upper Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the south-eastern margin of the Bohemian Massif are a part of Middle to Late Jurassic sedimentation cycle and represent a development of Tethyan shelf. The rocks can be divided into three facies: the basin facies formed in deeper environments (sublittoral up to bathyal zone), the carbonate platform deposited in a maximum depth of several tens of meters, and the shelf lagoon (Fig. 2). The sedimentation cycle began during the Callovian and its base is characterized by clastic sediments, which gradually pass into limestones, marlstones, and spongolites. During the Callovian and Oxfordian a regional transgression progressed deep into the Bohemian Massif from Tethys and the epicontinental sea of Western Europe at the same time, and likely produced a seaway across the Bohemian Massif. The gradual regression during the Kimmeridgian and late Tithonian terminated the sedimentation cycle (Eliáš 1981; Suk et al. 1984).",a tooth (IGS-MJ-0001),447,447,0,R. Benson,R.

The weighted mean age of 151.50 ± 0.28 Ma (Tithonian, Late Jurassic) is interpreted as the best esti- mate of the volcanic ashfall age of the four youngest zir- con crystals. The presence of rounded detrital grains and slightly older euhedral zircons, however, implies that even the youngest ages could be from detrital grains; as a result, the weighted mean represents a maximum depositional age. This age places the Cisco Mammal Quarry approximately 1 million years younger than Quarry 9 at Como Bluff (152.51 ± 0.47 Ma, Trujillo et al. 2015), and approximately 0.5 million years younger than the Main Callison Quarry at the Fruita Paleontological Area (152.0 ± 0.3 Ma, Foster et al. 2017).

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

(2011: Palaeo3 302: 194-205) proposed, on the basis of multiple lines of biostratigraphic evidence, that the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is placed within the middle part of the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation where this member is present, and high in the Dinosaur Canyon Member elsewhere. The ""Whitmore Point assemblage"" of vertebrate taxa, earliest Jurassic (Hettangian) in age. The underlying ""Dinosaur Canyon assemblage"", is latest Triassic (Rhaetian) in age.\r\n\r\nBecause the stratigraphic position of this site within the Moenave is unclear, a Rhaetian–Hettangian age is given.
