Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times. The fact that fossil root casts are present in the tuff to the southwest and east of Rabbit Valley, but absent in the area of the quarry, implies that the lake level receded temporarily, although water remained in the area of the quarry.

Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times.

The weighted mean age of 151.50 ± 0.28 Ma (Tithonian, Late Jurassic) is interpreted as the best esti- mate of the volcanic ashfall age of the four youngest zir- con crystals. The presence of rounded detrital grains and slightly older euhedral zircons, however, implies that even the youngest ages could be from detrital grains; as a result, the weighted mean represents a maximum depositional age. This age places the Cisco Mammal Quarry approximately 1 million years younger than Quarry 9 at Como Bluff (152.51 ± 0.47 Ma, Trujillo et al. 2015), and approximately 0.5 million years younger than the Main Callison Quarry at the Fruita Paleontological Area (152.0 ± 0.3 Ma, Foster et al. 2017). However, it should be noted that the ranges of these ages do overlap leaving open the possibility that CMQ and FPA are contemporaneous.","""The locality is at the top of a rounded, pale-gray knob ...

Barite nodules occur in this facies, suggesting the occasional presence of standing water.

Oolites are most commonly generated in medium to high energy, shallow carbonate platforms that are super-saturated with respect to calcium carbonate. Deposition buildups can occur in shoreline localities, such as tidal areas and marginal shoaling environments under warm, tropical climates.
